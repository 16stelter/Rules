\bigskip

The goal of the high jump challenge is to terminate ground contact and to stay
in the air as long as possible.
Robots are placed on a contact device or clearly marked area of approximately 60 {\texttimes} 60 cm.
A fully successful jump requires the robot to remain upright for a minimum of 3
seconds after landing without leaving the measuring device or clearly marked area.
All other attempts are considered partially successful.
This includes attempts in which the robot handler touched the robot after landing
but before the 3 seconds have exceeded.
The robots are ranked first according to the time of flight of fully successful
attempts and then according to the time of flight of partially successful attempts.
