{\bfseries \color[rgb]{0.4,0.4,0.4} Part C: High Jump}

\bigskip

The goal of the high jump challenge is to terminate ground contact and to stay in the air as long as possible. Robots are placed on a contact device of approximately 40 {\texttimes} 40 cm that records the time of
flight of a jump. A fully successful jump requires the robot to remain upright for a minimum of 3 seconds after landing without leaving the measuring device. All other attempts are considered partially successful. The robots are ranked first according to the time of flight of fully successful attempts and then according to the time of flight of partially successful attempts.
