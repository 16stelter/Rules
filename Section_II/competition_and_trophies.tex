\bigskip

{\bfseries Setup and Inspections}

\headlinebox

The competitions in the Humanoid League are preceded by a setup and inspection period of at least 24 h. During this time, every robot will be inspected by the league organizing committee for compliance with the design rules detailed in law 4. All robots will be photographed during
the inspection. A reinspection becomes necessary after any change that could affect the compliance to the design rules. A reinspection might be requested by any team leader up to 1 hour prior to a game.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Referee Duty}

\headlinebox

Each team must name at least one person who is familiar with the rules and who might be assigned for referee duties by the league organizing committee.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Competitions}

\headlinebox

The competitions consist of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Soccer games for KidSize (4 vs. 4),
\item Soccer games for TeenSize (3 vs. 3),
\item Dribble and Kick for AdultSize,
\item Technical challenges.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

In the event of less than 3 teams participating in TeenSize the TeenSize teams will join the AdultSize for a joint Dribble and Kick competition.

\bigskip

The technical challenges consist of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Push Recovery (KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize)
\item Goal Kick from Moving Ball (KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize)
\item High Jump (KidSize and TeenSize and AdultSize)
\item High-Kick (KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize)
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Both, Soccer Games (KidSize and TeenSize) and Dribble and Kick (AdultSize) are organized in one or more round robins and playoffs. For the first round robin, the teams are assigned to groups at random. All teams of a group play once against each other. The round robin games may end in a draw. In this case, both teams receive one point. Otherwise, the winning team receives three points and the not winning team receives zero points.

\bigskip

After games of a round robin have been played, the teams of a group are ranked based on (in decreasing priority): 

\begin{enumerate}
\item the number of earned points,
\item the goal-difference,
\item the absolute number of goals,
\item the result of a direct match,
\item the time needed to score a penalty kick into an empty goal (up to five alternating attempts to score, until at least one team scored),
\item the drawing of a lot.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

For each game that a team has won with a difference of 10 goals only 10 goals are counted.

\bigskip

At least two teams of every group will enter the next round robin or the playoffs.

\bigskip

The game plan needs to be announced prior to the random assignment of teams to groups.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Gameplay}

\headlinebox
 
{\bfseries Kick-off procedure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The referee gives the signal ``READY'' that all robots have to reach their own half of the field. Robots not being able to position autonomously in their own half may be placed by their respective robot handler.
\item The opponents of the team taking the kick-off are outside the center circle until the ball is in play.
\item The referee gives the signal ``SET''. The referee calls robots illegally positioned to be set back manually
by the respective robot handler to the outer line of their goal area. One field player of a manually or illegally positioned team suffers a removal penalty (cf. Section 12)
\item The ball is stationary on the center mark. 
\item The referee gives the signal ``PLAY'' or whistles.
\item The ball is in play when it is touched or 10 seconds elapsed after the signal.
\end{itemize}

Robots being able to autonomously reposition themselves can take any position on the field that is consistent with above requirements. Robots not able to autonomously reposition themselves, e.g. robots being carried or joysticked around by human team members, have to start
from a position not closer to the field halfway line than the outer line of the goal area. If all robots of the team executing the kick-off cannot autonomously reposition themselves, then one robot may be placed into the center circle.

If one or both of the teams in a match have permission to use a manual startup procedure, the referee gives the two signals ``SET'' and ``PLAY'' with an interval of exactly
10 seconds. Robot players without remote start capability may be started on the field after the ``SET'' signal. They may not move before the ``PLAY'' signal was given
by the referee. Robots with autonomous positioning ability are given between 15 and 30 seconds for re-positioning after a goal has been scored by one of the teams before the ``SET'' signal for kick-off is given by the referee. All human team members must leave the field of play
immediately after the ``SET'' signal and before the ``PLAY'' signal.

A team which uses manual kick-off and not kick-off with the referee box is punished by a penalty of having to wait for 15 seconds after the signal ``PLAY'' before they are
allowed to locomote. If such a team has kick-off then at the signal ``PLAY'' the referee immediately moves the ball from the kick-off position to a position somewhere on
the center line and outside of the center circle and the ball is in play. This rule does not apply if the referee box is out of commission.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Free-kick procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Referee - blows whistle, announces call (e.g., illegal defense), maybe places the ball depending on the call, and then announces Free Kick Blue/Red.
\item Game controller clicks on Free Kick Blue/Red Ready mode. Now opponent robots must move to a position at least 50cm away from the ball. They have a maximum of 15 secs. to do this or sooner if the referee thinks the kicking team is ready and all opponent robots are at least 50cm
away.
\item Any opponent robot still closer than 50cm must be considered as an incapable player.
\item Referee blows whistle, then Game controller clicks on Free Kick Blue/Red mode. team can kick, and ball is in play after 10 secs.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Incapable Players}

Players not capable of play (e.g. players not able to walk on two legs, players not able to stand, or players with obvious malfunctions) are not permitted to participate in the game. They must be removed from the field. It is up to the referee to judge whether a player is capable of play. The referee may ask the team leader of a player suspected to be incapable of play to demonstrate playing ability at any time. A field player that is not able to get back into a stable standing or walking posture from a fall within 20 seconds will be removed from the field for 30 seconds removal penalty and has to reenter the field from the center of the touch line as indicated by the
referee.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Substitutions}

Up to two players per game can be substituted by other players of the same team. The referee must be informed prior to the substitution. A substitute only enters the field after the player being replaced left the field and after receiving a signal from the referee. Any of the
other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that the referee is informed before the change is made and that the change is made during a stoppage of the match. Exchanging a field player with a goalie does not count as substitution. Changing places/roles between a
field player and a goalie does not count as substitution.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Temporal Absence}

Servicing robots on the playing field is not permitted. A robot may be taken out of the field for service, after receiving permission from the referee. Taking out a robot for service does not count as a substitution. A serviced robot may not come into play again before 30 s elapsed after it was taken out. It has to enter the field from the
center point of the touch line as indicated by the referee.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Best Humanoid Award (Louis Vuitton Cup)}

\headlinebox
 
The teams of all three size classes are ranked in separate lists to determine the overall best humanoid.

The ranking is based on the aggregated number of points earned in the individual competitions.

\bigskip

The points earned in the technical challenge are used directly.

\bigskip

For the Dribble and Kick competitions (AdultSize) and the Soccer Games (Kid- Size and TeenSize) the winner receives 60 points. The second best team receives 42 points. The third best team receives 30 points.

\bigskip

As KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize robots do not compete directly, a jury decides the overall best humanoid robot, 2nd best humanoid robot, 3rd best humanoid robot. The jury consists of the team leaders of all teams, except for the teams ranked first in the KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize lists. The jury decides by majority vote. In case of a draw, the president of the RoboCup federation decides the vote.

\begin{itemize}
\item The teams ranked first in the KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize lists are candidates for the best humanoid. The jury decides from the general picture of the performance according to the criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Robustness
\item Walking ability
\item Ball handling
\item Soccer skills
\end{enumerate}
for the robot that is the best humanoid.
\item Of each, KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize, the best robot that was not chosen to be the best humanoid robot is candidate for the 2nd best humanoid robot. Criteria are the same as for the best humanoid.
\item The robot ranked first in the KidSize, TeenSize or AdultSize lists that was not chosen for 1st or 2nd best humanoid is the 3rd best humanoid robot.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Trophies}

\headlinebox

A trophy is awarded to the winner of each of the individual competitions and technical challenges. In case of less than 3 teams participating in a size class no trophies will be given in this class.

\bigskip

A trophy is awarded to the teams second and third in the KidSize 3-3 soccer game, the TeenSize 2-2 soccer games and the AdultSize Dribble and Kick competition. In case of less than 5 teams participating in a size class the team ranked third will be awarded a certificate instead of a trophy. In case of less than 4 teams participating in a size class the team ranked second will also be awarded a certificate instead of a trophy. The final number of trophies awarded will be decided by the RoboCup Federation based on the number of actually participating teams.

\bigskip

Certificates are awarded to the teams second and third in the technical challenges and to the teams ranked second and third in the Best Humanoid list.

\bigskip

The Louis Vuitton Humanoid Cup is awarded to the team ranked first in the Best Humanoid list.
